# TCGA 40-Case Experiment

## Description
This repository contains the code, results, and visual outputs for a pilot
experiment conducted on 40 TCGA pancreatic cancer cases.

The goal of this experiment was to evaluate image segmentation quality and
attention-based multiple instance learning for patient-level prediction.

## Contents
- Code used for training, inference, and visualization
- Quantitative results and summary metrics
- Visual examples of segmentation and attention maps

## Dataset
- Source: TCGA-PAAD
- Number of cases: 40

Raw TCGA data is not included due to data usage restrictions.

## Repository Structure
- `code/`: scripts used in the experiment
- `results/`: numerical results and full outputs
- `figures/`: selected qualitative examples
- `data/`: cohort metadata and splits

## Notes
This repository corresponds to an initial pilot experiment.
The project structure is designed to be extended to additional cohorts
in future work.
